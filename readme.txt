Compile Metallic, Bevel, SmoothEdge and Chrome and put the binaries in the GeglChrome folder and then put GeglChrome inside /gegl-0.4/plug-ins. If you already have gegl:bevel and gegl:metallic remove them. Unless you have a older version. If you have two copies of the same plugin things will be fine but GEGL will always call the oldest version. Linux users can use precompiled binaries. Gimpchat.org usually has a Windows Version that other parties compile.
